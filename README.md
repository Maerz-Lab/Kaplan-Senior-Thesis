# Kaplan-Senior-Thesis
The objective of this thesis is to compile captive rearing information over the past fourteen years into a comprehensive guide on each step of captive rearing gopher frogs in Georgia. After compiling this guide, multiple variables will be analyzed for efficiency and effect, including temperature and weather data, clutch information, and survival rates. I predict that we will find a correlation between years with greater humidity and rainfall and higher survival rates. I do not yet have a prediction for how egg clutches affect overall data, as I have not viewed the information about these clutches yet.
