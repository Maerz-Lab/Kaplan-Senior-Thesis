# Kaplan-Senior-Thesis
The objective of this thesis is to compile captive rearing information over the past fourteen years into a comprehensive guide on each step of captive rearing gopher frogs in Georgia. After compiling this guide, multiple variables will be analyzed for efficiency and effect, including temperature and weather data, clutch information, and survival rates. I predict that we will find a correlation between years with greater humidity and rainfall and higher survival rates. I do not yet have a prediction for how egg clutches affect overall data, as I have not viewed the information about these clutches yet.

This thesis aims to summarize the fifteen years of Gopher frog captive rearing data from the UGA program and to analyze how stocking densities and weather patterns affect interannual rearing success and the potential for outbreaks of disease or abnormalities. I will estimate random variation in rearing success related to clutch identity. This thesis will formalize the existing rearing protocol for dissemination and use by other amphibian captive-rearing programs. I aim to model the effects of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and stocking densities, on mass at metamorphosis, the time it takes to metamorphize, and disease and abnormalities. I expect development to be slower in cooler, rainier years because of the effects of temperature and light on algal production in aquaculture tanks. I also expect higher mortality in very hot years associated with reduced dissolved oxygen and stress-related outbreaks of disease or abnormalities. Years with moderate temperatures and humidity will likely produce frogs of the greatest mass. It is anticipated that disease outbreaks to be more numerous in tanks with higher stocking densities, and for masses to be higher in tanks with lower stocking densities.
